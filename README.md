# Python Final Project - Louis Killian Marc
The final project repository of Louis MARTYR, Killian LAFAYE and Marc LEMAISTRE

## Here are the main work done through this project:

### Problematic
Can we give a realistic estimation of the obesity level of someone purely based on their eating habits and physical condition ?
Link to our dataset: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/dataset/544/estimation+of+obesity+levels+based+on+eating+habits+and+physical+condition

### Data cleaning & visualization
Understanding our dataset and each of its features, then cleaning it to get rid of all of the useless values and features.
Creating some visualizations to facilitate the comprehension of all of our data and to help us figure out which features to keep for our prediction model.

### Prediction model
Creating a prediction algorithm based on most of the features included in this dataset to try and predict in which obesity level category a person belongs in based on their eating habits and physical attributes (except for their weight as it would give too much information for our predictions to be intereseting).

### API implementation
Developping an API to apply our model on and getting back its results. The python file to run it locally is the main.py file. You then need to launch the server via uvicorn to make it work.

### Local web display
Developping a local display using HTML to give a nicer look to our prediction model if you wish to test it on specific parameters. The code for this lies in the online API DASH.py file, and the HTML pages are located in the HTML_contents directory.

### Powerpoint presentation
Creating a powerpoint presentation to show the big lines of our work.
